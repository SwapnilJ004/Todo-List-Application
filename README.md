Todo List is a set of everyday professional or unprofessional tasks which are stored in form a list, such that a todo task can be added or deleted from this list.
The importance of using a todo record lies in not remembering or forget your todos and these todos are accessible anytime at your browser.

This is a simple todo list which can store the list of todo items for you, privately and locally to your browser. It can store, manage, delete and even can mark as done.

It uses angular framework on frontend and bootstrap. It is created as a tutorial learning by Swapnil Joshi, referenced from CodeWithHarry.

The main functionality served by angular is that the page doesn't gets reload while opening internal links within the site. I hope you enjoy this application :).
